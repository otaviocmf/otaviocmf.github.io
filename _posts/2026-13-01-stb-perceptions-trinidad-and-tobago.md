## 🌊 **Introduction: A Small Island State's Vision for Global Agricultural Sustainability**

In a world confronting existential challenges in food security, climate resilience, and social equity, the quest for genuinely sustainable agricultural models has evolved from a technical concern to a civilizational imperative. It is within this context of urgency and hope that the Science and Technology Backyard (STB) concept emerges—an innovation philosophy that is redefining rural extension paradigms and technology transfer on a global scale.

The International Science and Technology Backyard Forum, held in January 2026, represented far more than an academic gathering—it constituted a historical inflection point where tradition and innovation, local knowledge and global science, small-scale farmers and leading researchers engaged in profound, transformative dialogue. Over three intensive days, representatives from over forty nations shared not merely data and statistics, but narratives of change that are reshaping rural landscapes across all continents. It was a pleasure for me to work in the conference as a translator for my english speaking colleagues and to gain knowledge and insights about modern agriculture.

### **The Caribbean Context: Unique Challenges, Unique Opportunities**

As a representative from Trinidad and Tobago—a twin-island state in the Caribbean—my participation carried particular significance. Our agricultural reality is characterized by:

1. **Limited land availability** (only 25% of total land area suitable for agriculture)
2. **High vulnerability to climate change** (hurricanes, drought, sea-level rise)
3. **Dependence on food imports** (over 80% of food consumed is imported)
4. **Rich biodiversity** with untapped potential for sustainable cultivation
5. **Strong traditional knowledge** in tropical crop management

The STB model, originally conceived in China, is based on a radically simple yet profoundly powerful premise: instead of bringing farmers to university laboratories, researchers and students move into the backyards—literally and metaphorically—of rural communities. This geographical inversion symbolizes an epistemological revolution: knowledge ceases to flow vertically, top-down, and instead circulates horizontally within collaborative networks where traditional wisdom and scientific understanding mutually enrich each other.

What we witnessed at this forum was the maturation of this concept into complete innovation ecosystems. These are no longer isolated projects or piecemeal initiatives, but integrated systems where agricultural policy, university research, technological development, and community capacity-building converge to create contextualized, scalable solutions. Every session, every panel, every conversation in the corridors revealed a complex mosaic of approaches that, in their diversity, shared a common denominator: an uncompromising commitment to socio-environmental justice and food sovereignty.

##  **A Transformative Experience**

It was a profound honor to participate in the **International Science and Technology Backyard Forum**, an enriching experience that brought together brilliant minds from around the world to discuss sustainable agricultural innovation.

###  **Key Insights Gained**

#### 1. **Adaptable STB Models**
I learned how the "Science and Technology Backyard" concept is being adapted across diverse cultural and agricultural contexts, from Asia to Latin America to the Caribbean.

#### 2. **Appropriate Technologies for Island States**
I discovered numerous low-cost technologies that could revolutionize smallholder farming in Caribbean island nations, particularly those addressing:
- Water conservation in drought-prone regions
- Hurricane-resilient infrastructure
- Post-harvest loss reduction in humid climates

#### 3. **Global Collaboration Networks**
The event facilitated the creation of an international network of researchers and professionals committed to sustainability, with special attention to Small Island Developing States (SIDS).

## 🌱 **Technical Analyses and International Cooperation**

### 🚜 **Development of Machinery for Small Producers in Brazil**

Brazil presented remarkable advances in developing technologies adapted to family farming. During technical sessions, several innovations were demonstrated:

**Highlighted Innovations:**
1. **Low-Power, Affordable Tractors**
